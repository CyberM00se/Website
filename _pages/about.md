Welcome to my website! My Name is Noah Beckman. I am currently double majoring in Networking and Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at Champlain College. Over the course of the last couple years I have worked at a variety of companies and on a variety of projects.

I have experience working with security and forensics tools such as FTK imager, MITRE, Burp Suite, Wireshark and More. 

In my freetime I enjoy gaming, participating in CTFs, aquiring certificates, and Lockpicking. When i'm not working on cyber security or forensics, I play guitar, enjoy aviation, and cooking.

Over the past couple years, I have been working on many projects. Some of my early projects I worked on include video games made for Game Jam competitions. Today I am working on a mesh network project for secure communication and a secondary project doing forensics on the upcoming windows 11.
